For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be running DevStack.
  - Ubuntu 12.04
  - At least 2 GB of RAM

For IDE, use any of your favorite Python IDE or text editor:
  - PyCharm
  - PyDev
  - Komodo
  - Emacs
  - Vi

If you are a developer, I recommend getting a VM since DevStack installs a lot of dependencies, and makes a lot of changes to your system. 

There are a lot of options for getting a VM:

1. Using Virtualbox

2. Using VMWare Fusion

3. Rackspace Cloud Server

Also checkout Vagrant as it now supports all of the above.
